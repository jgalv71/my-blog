# My Python Journey

As a student at WGU, I’ve started learning Python and am tackling foundational concepts like loops, data structures, and functions. Here’s an update on my progress!

## Key Concepts Learned
- **Loops**: I’ve written a few programs using `for` and `while` loops.
- **Data Structures**: Working with lists and dictionaries to store data.
- **Functions**: I’m starting to break down problems into reusable code with functions.

## Challenges
- Debugging and testing code can sometimes be frustrating, but I’m learning to troubleshoot with print statements and using Python’s built-in `pdb` debugger.

## Next Steps
- I plan to tackle more complex problems, like building a basic calculator or a small text-based game.

Stay tuned for more updates!
